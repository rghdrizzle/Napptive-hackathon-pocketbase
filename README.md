PocketBase is a lightweight and easy-to-use NoSQL database designed for mobile and web applications. It allows you to store and retrieve data in a flexible and scalable manner, without the need for complex setup or maintenance.

## Getting Started:
NAPPTIVE is the cloud-native application platform. It provides an integrated solution that can be used by any member of your organization including developers and non-technical users to deploy applications in modern infrastructures.
The Napptive playground gives instant access to a cloud-native application platform based on Kubernetes, with support for the Open Application Model (OAM). With the playground you will be able to save DevOps and Developer time by streamlining operations around infrastructure:
<ul>
<li>Reduce deadtime waiting for clusters to be available
<li>    Reduce time spent installing and managing one-use infrastructure for your team members</li>
<li>    Stop reusing Kubernetes namespaces</li>
 <li>   Easy integration with CI/CD tools</li>
  <li>  Work with isolated environments to accommodate your workloads: testing, developing, staging or production workloads</li>
   <li> Avoid reusing namespaces with the self-service provisioning capabilities</li>
   </ul>
Once you have an active account, you are ready to deploy our application. The simplest way is to leverage our catalog which provides a collection of OAM applications that are ready to be used.  Lets deploy Pocketbase using catalog.
First, list the available applications and select the version to be deployed. Click on the upper left hand corner icon to list all the available applications. By default the available apps list and the summary will be shown as you can see in the below picture. Click on the Pocketbase application of the Napptive catalog namespace, then select the tag to be deployed, (the active one appears with the aquamarine background) and click on the Deploy button at the top right to get to the app deploy configuration screen. In the “Deploy” step screen you can set different elements for the application deployment
To open the application, click on the endpoint button in the application information. (Make sure to add /_/ at the end of the endpoint )
This is the page that you should be getting after loginng in :

Now To get started with PocketBase, you need to sign up for an account at the endpoint to create an admin account.
Once you have created an account, you can create a new database by clicking on the "Create Database" button on the dashboard.
PocketBase provides a RESTful API for interacting with your database. You can use any programming language or platform that supports HTTP requests to interact with your database.
To get started with the API, you can refer to the documentation available at https://www.pocketbase.io/docs.
